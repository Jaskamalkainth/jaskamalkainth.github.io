# Projects

* [**Energy-Efficient Scheduling Algorithms:**](/projects/JaskamalKainthCS_Thesis.pdf) (May 2018)

    Benchmarking Scheduling algorithms like HEFT, Deadline slack, NDES, GDES using C++ to conclude the best algorithm for which the energy consumption is minimum for a real-time parallel application on a heterogeneous distributed embedded system.  


* [**Numerical solutions for PDEs in Option pricing:**](projects/JaskamalKainthMATH_Thesis .pdf) (Dec 2017)
    
    Applying the *B-Spline collocation method* and *Radial basis function method* to solve the **Black Scholes equation** used in Option pricing.
