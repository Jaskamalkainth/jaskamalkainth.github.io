# Struct vs Class in C++

In C++, `struct` and `class` are nearly identical, with only one difference in their default access level.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Struct | Class |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Default access modifier | public | private |
| Default inheritance | public | private |
| Intended use (convention) | Passive data structures | Objects with behavior |

## Example

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x; // public by default
    int y; // public by default
};

class Circle {
private: // private by default, but explicitly shown for clarity
    Point center;
    double radius;
    
public:
    Circle(Point c, double r) : center(c), radius(r) {}
    double area() const { return 3.14159 * radius * radius; }
};
```

## When to Use Each

- Use `struct` when you have a simple data structure with little or no behavior
- Use `class` when you have an object with both data and behavior that operates on that data
- Use `struct` when all members should be publicly accessible
- Use `class` when you need to enforce encapsulation by making some members private

The choice between `struct` and `class` is often a matter of convention and communicating intent to other programmers.
